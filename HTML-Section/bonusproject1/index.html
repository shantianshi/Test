                    <li>It had a helpless ending that I couldn't fathom which I thought was really cool.</li><br>
                    <li>Peter Dinklage showed up and he had a role of a giant dude!!!</li><br>
                    <li>Thanos gained a lot of memes after the movie release.</li><br>

                Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk and the rest of the Avengers unite to battle their most powerful enemy yet -- the evil Thanos.<br>
                On a mission to collect all six Infinity Stones, Thanos plans to use the artifacts to inflict his twisted will on reality. <br>
                The fate of the planet and existence itself has never been more uncertain as everything the Avengers have fought for has led up to this moment.<br>
